## Instructions

Your code **must** be properly formatted.  
You will lose marks for poorly formatted code.

If you have previous experience with JavaScript,  
you can use the **_let_** and **_const_** keywords 
instead of **_var_**.


## Questions 
> 1. Declare and initialise three **variables** with appropriate names and values. 
     * One variable with a number value,  
     * one with a boolean value  
     * and one with a string value.
     <br><br>
> 2. Declare two **variables**.  
     * Assign your first name to one of the variables  
     * and your last name to the other.  
     * [Concatenate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/concat) (join) the variables,  
     * assign them to a third variable  
     * and console log the value of the third variable.
     <br><br>
> 3. Check the type of the value "frog"   
     * with the `typeof` operator  
     * and assign the result to a variable.  
     * Console log the variable value with a label, e.g. `"The type of frog is ___"`.
     <br><br>
> 4. Declare and initialise a variable  
     * called `orderHasShipped` with a **boolean** value.  
     Create an `if` statement that checks `if` `orderHasShipped` is true.  
     If it is true, console log the string value `"The order shipped"`.  
     If not, console log the string value `"The order did not ship"`.
     <br><br>
> 5. Create a `for loop` that counts from 7 to 13.  
     Console log the value of the counter variable inside the loop.
